#Welcome to ShowMeLove
This project combines the strength of **Microsoft Azure** and **Project OxFord** in an application system that attempts to generate auto-evaulations of a given event. 
It does this by providing a _UWP Client Application_ intended to run on Mobile devices/tablets with cameras, that are used to take a picture of the participant, and then
transmits that image to Project Oxford for sentiment analysis. 

**_There are lots of moving parts in this solution_**

##UWP Client Application
The application at the hands of the consumer

##Web Administration Portal
For administration of events that the client recieves

##PowerBi
The final output aggregates of sentiments
